          This week I was introduced to version control, which is a way of tracking changes in coding or other projects. It basically creates a record of any and all changes made by participants, and includes detailed notes on when and why changes were made. This ensures that all versions of a project, from the earliest to the latest, are accessible at all times, which is a good thing in case you need to go back to earlier working versions in case of bugs, etc. It is also very important in large group projects, where people can work on the same material simultaneously and not delete each others’ work or otherwise confuse things. It is a good way to organize and view the progress being made and see who is responsible for which changes.

          Git is a software installed on the user’s local computer, and can be accessed from the command line interface. It is a simple and convenient way to commit changes made to a project, which is essentially creating a snapshot of the changes made with a few simple commands. It allows the user to label and create notes about the commit which keeps them organized. It also is easily integrated with GitHub or other repository sites to allow for collaboration.

          GitHub is a remote online repository for code projects and is ideal for collaborating with a team. The main benefit is it creates a record of commits and changes, viewable from anywhere and anyplace which makes it more reliable. GitHub also is the place where pull requests and merges are made, and basically streamlines the collaborative process for team members with a clear system for making and recording changes. There are other online repositories but GitHub is the most popular site, so if you want to open your code to the general public it is the most accessible.      </p>
