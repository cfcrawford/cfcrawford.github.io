<!-- 2.7 Reflection
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was challenging at first working with a pair since I had not done so before, but I think I learned more and completed it faster by doing it with another person and receiving their input.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing is a helpful tool for me since I am a visual learner. It helps to see how the wireframe correlates with the html code, and I like that I can edit it for simplicity and clarity.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided that a good wireframe for this challenge was simple and direct, without too many unnecessary boxes. We each put together our own wireframe and compared them, which gave me some useful feedback about which elements I needed and which ones I could do without.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about a few HTML5 semantic elements such as the nav, aside and article tags.
