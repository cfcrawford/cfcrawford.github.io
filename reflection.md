**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned a lot about the difference between padding, borders and margin and how they work to position elements on a page. I used a border so that I could see how the padding and margins worked differently, the padding positioned the content within the border and the margins positioned the content relative to other elements.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I’ve learned about the differences between relative, absolute and fixed positioning and how they control the flow of the elements. I’m still learning which ones to use to achieve the right positioning.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

I found design elements such as color and font to be the easiest to implement, and the most difficult was getting my elements into the position I wanted them in according to my wireframes. In some cases I was able to more or less match the wireframe, but decided to tweak the layout once I was able to see it on the screen.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I gained a lot of valuable practice through trial and error. I learned that even though there are multiple ways to achieve a layout look there are some best practices to follow, and I also learned I have a ways to go learning about making the web page layout look good even when the screen size is changed.
